**User Stories**:

As a **student**, I want to stay up to date with the latest UF Computer Science information, events, and opportunities, so that I can help myself to break into tech. 

As a **researcher**, I want to reach out to computer science students at UF and find a research assistant, so that I can get necessary aid with my work and give students opportunities to get more involved in computer science outside of the classroom.

As a **website administrator**, I want to maintain and organize content as well as manage opportunity postings and user profiles, so that I can give different users their appropriate permissions and ensure the application is functional, accurate, and up-to-date.

As a **tutor**, I want to promote my services and any helpful resources I know of to a greater range of computer science students, so that I can have better exposure and be of great aid to many others who wish to receive help with their CISE courses.

These goals were unable to be achieved by the end of Sprint 1. As beginners to TypeScript, Go, and all of the new frameworks, we had no point of reference for how long these objectives would take to complete and how difficult they were. A large amount of time was dedicated to installing new frameworks and getting a new project working with both TypeScript and Go. These will be our first goals to complete for Sprint 2.
