As a student, I want to stay up to date with the latest UF Computer Science information, events, and opportunities, so that I can help myself to break into tech. 

As a researcher, I want to reach out to computer science students at UF and find a research assistant, so that I can get necessary aid with my work and give students opportunities to get more involved in computer science outside of the classroom.
