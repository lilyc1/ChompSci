# ChompSci
A web-based application designed to bring the UF Computer Science community together by promoting and organizing events and opportunities, as well as encouraging CS students to connect more with one another. 

This application would have different features as listed below:

1. A homepage with weekly events and opportunities from different computer-science based organizations
2. A calendar with all CS events listed in one place and the potential to link it to the user's own Google calendar
3. Individual profiles for CS students and professors
4. Badges to incentivize students to take part in events and opportunities promoted through the website
5. A help/tutoring tab to assist students in finding resources to succeed in their CS courses but to also help students network with each other to share career experiences and provide mentorship.

The primary objective will be for students to share opportunities and network to ultimately help each other succeed in the world of computer science. Having as many opportunities listed all together in one website will allow UF computer science students to not only learn about but take advantage of as many resources as possible from the rest of the UF computer science community.
